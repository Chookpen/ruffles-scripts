## Want to make your own scripts?

### There's a couple of rules and regulations to abide by, but otherwise you're free to use your script to install your app however you want!

Here be the rules:

1. No scripts that will download malicious software, and no malicious scripts either. (We do check!)
2. Echo any updates in what the script is doing to the terminal, so the user knows what's going on.
3. Make it so your script only installs and configures your app. Don't make it do too much
4. Get your script to install your app to the /ruffles/(your-app-name) directory and create a symbolic link in the /ruffles folder.
5. If your Ruffles script installs a Flatpak, make a symbolic link or script to run the flatpak in the /ruffles folder.
6. Leave funny messages in your code becuase why not?

### But can't be bothered to write the script yourself?

Just copy https://github.com/Chookpen/ruffles-scripts/scripts/test and edit the links to make your own script! After that, make a pull request and we'll approve or deny your script.
